# HIE Overview

Our SOPs on this documentation assume the [OpenHIE pattern](https://ohie.org/framework/) will be used as the standards base for the HIE architecture.  The following is generally the envisioned architecture that we work with for designing and developing our workflows, although in some cases there are exceptions made due to context of the environment, governance, and resources in which the implementation occurs.

We are currently documenting the SOP that we have taken for the LIS Workflows that we have in production environments.  Following that documentation, we will address documenting a step by step SOP for Patient Identification workflows.  If you have other workflows that you have in production, that you would like for us to build an SOP for, please contact us to collaborate on the documentation here.
