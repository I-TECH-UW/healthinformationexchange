## Botswana HIE

### Overview
This guide provides a starting point for learning about the **Botswana Health Information Exchange (HIE)**. The project is based on the **OpenHIE architecture** and uses the **Instant OpenHIE V2** tooling to for packaging, deployment, and horizontal scalability. Currently, the HIE consists of core components of the HIE architecture customized to the Botswana context, as well as components supporting two target workflows: Patient Identity Management and Laboratory Order and Result Management. As this project levereges a number of open standards and global goods (OpenHIE, FHIR, HIE IGs, etc.), this documentation contains a number of references to useful external resources.

### Botswana HIE Architecture

The Botswana HIE is based on the OpenHIE architecture. The following diagram shows the core components of the HIE architecture, and highlights the components currently in scope for implementation as part of the Botswana HIE project.

### Botswana HIE Component Index: Managed by I-TECH

#### Interoperabilâ‰ˆity Layer
*[Link to OpenHIE Documentation](https://guides.ohie.org/arch-spec/openhie-component-specifications-1/openhie-interoperability-layer-iol)*

The Interoperability Layer (IOL) is the core component of the OpenHIE architecture responsible for securely routing messages between the various other components of the HIE, and providing the entrypoint interface for external point-of-service clients. This layer is implemented using [OpenHIM](https://openhim.org/).

#### Client Registry (Master Patient Index)
*[Link to OpenHIE Documentation](https://guides.ohie.org/arch-spec/openhie-component-specifications-1/client-registry)*

The Client Registry (CR) is responsible for linking and managing the identities of patients across the health system. This component is iplemented using [OpenCR](https://github.com/intrahealth/client-registry).

#### Shared Health Record 
*[Link to OpenHIE Documentation](https://guides.ohie.org/arch-spec/openhie-component-specifications-1/openhie-shared-health-record-shr)*

The Shared Health Record (SHR) service stores the longitudal health record for each patient from across the health system. This component supports workflows that require access to a shared central repository of patient data, such and laboratory order and result workflows. This component is implemented using [SHR](https://github.com/i-tech-uw/shared-health-record).

#### Terminology Service
*[Link to OpenHIE Documentation](https://guides.ohie.org/arch-spec/openhie-component-specifications-1/openhie-terminology-service-ts)*

The Terminology Service (TS) is responsible for managing terminology collections from across the health system and their mappings to standard terminologies. This component is implemented using [Open Concept Lab](https://openconceptlab.org/). 

### Botswana HIE Component Index: Externally Managed

#### Facility Registry (Master Facility List)
*[Link to OpenHIE Documentation](https://guides.ohie.org/arch-spec/openhie-component-specifications-1/openhie-facility-registry-fr)*

The Facility Registry (FR) or Master Facility List (MFL) is responsible for managing the list of facilities and their health services across the health system.
