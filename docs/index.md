# Welcome to the HIE Data Exchange Workflows Knowledge Base!
The Documentation Steward: [The Digital Initiatives Group at I-TECH (DIGI), University of Washington](https://www.go2itech.org/digital-initiatives-group-at-i-tech/about-digi/)

The purpose of this website is to share our approach to setting up some of the common standards-based HIE workflows using digital health solutions that have been utilized in low-to-middle income countries.  This is not intended to be a comprehensive guide for all HIE workflows in a healthcare environment, nor to assume this is the only approach that can be taken.  We welcome any and all feedback to improve the site, or to update the approach.
