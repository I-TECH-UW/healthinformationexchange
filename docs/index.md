# Welcome to the HIE Data Exchange Workflows Knowledge Base
Documentation Steward: [The Digital Initiatives Group at I-TECH (DIGI), University of Washington](https://www.go2itech.org/digital-initiatives-group-at-i-tech/about-digi/)

The purpose of this website is to share our approach to setting up some of the common standards-based HIE workflows using digital health solutions that have been utilized in low-to-middle income countries.  This is not intended to be a comprehensive guide for all HIE workflows in a healthcare environment, nor to assume this is the only approach that can be taken.  We welcome any and all feedback to improve the site, or to update the approach.

The Digital Initiatives Group is a global health informatics center housed within the I-TECH organization at the University of Washington.  Our team specializes in health information exchange, and specifically laboratory informatics and exchanges, in resource constrained environments.  We work at the informatics domain level, developing global goods and publishing internationally accepted informatics standards; and support the countries and implementers applying those in national health programs across the globe.  We are collaborators at heart, so please join us in innovating on improvements to the work and the documentation here.
