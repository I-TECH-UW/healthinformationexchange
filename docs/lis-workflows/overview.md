A critical workflow for high quality care is the timely and accurate exchange of laboratory orders and test results between the clinic and laboratories.  To digitize this workflow, you need an electronic medical record (EMR) capable of capturing orders, and a laboratory information system (LIS/LIMS) capable of order entry and capturing of test results associated with that order.  Using the most recent informatics standards, this digitized Lab Order and Results workflow SOP focuses on the use of FHIR and the OpenHIE architectural pattern for implementation, and includes several implementation approaches depending on context (i.e. direct bridge, older messaging standards only in the local systems).  This Lab Order and Results workflow utilizes the [FHIR Workflow Module](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/workflow-module.html) and suggested [Communication Patterns](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/workflow-communications.html#12.6.2.1) to implement the ordering of lab tests from an EMR to an LIS and resulting from LIS to EMR.
